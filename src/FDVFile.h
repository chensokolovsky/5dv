int convert(char* inputPath, char* outputPath, int shouldCompress);




// Same as with the uncompressed version. Starting version 7, we no longer want to save/load the enntire buffer
// We have new methods to create/read a file and its header, and methods to write/read a single frame from the buffer
/// This is dont not to allocate memory for a full movie buffer.
// These two methods won't be used anymore
//int saveFDVFile(struct FDVFile* file,char* name);
//int loadFDVFile(char* name, struct FDVFile* file);


// Instead we will use methods like these:
int createFDVFile(char* name, struct FDVFileHeader header, FILE** fp);
int openFDVFile(char* name, struct FDVFileHeader* header, FILE** fp);

// Writing and reading will just use the regular FILE write/read methods. No need for a special interface really
// The writer/reader will make sure to read/write in buffers not larger than a frame
// example:  fwrite(buffer,totalBytes,1,fp);
//  fread(buffer,totalBytes,1,fp);
//
// Also, caller should close the file
// fclose(fp)
