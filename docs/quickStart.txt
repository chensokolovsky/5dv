5dv - quick start:

—————————————————————————————

There are 2 file types:
fileName.5dv - the compressed file
fileName.5dvu - the uncompressed file.

The uncompressed file is the raw information RGBA of Width x Depth x Height
See docs/Documentation.txt in the repo for more details about the uncompressed file format

—————————————————————————————

To fastest way to check the simulator is this:

1) In terminal, create a folder for the new file:
mkdir /myFolder

2) Run 5dv once to create an uncompressed spheres file. This creates a short 30 fps 2 shares moving in a 3d box;
./5dv create spheres /myFolder/spheres.5dvu

3) Run 5dv again to display the uncompressed file:
./5dv display /myFolder/spheres.5dvu

Discussion:
- There is no compression in this example, only a primary simulator check
- Make sure to run the ./5dv command from the executable folder (unless it is in a default path on your machine)
- The new folder path can be absolute (i.e.: /Users/myName/Desktop/MyPrograms/5dv/)

—————————————————————————————

The fastest way to test encoder decoder is this:

1) In terminal, create a folder for the new files
mkdir /myFolder2

2) Tun 5dv full process. This will create spheres, encode them, decode them, and display both compression qualities side by side:
./5dv full /myFolder2

Discussion:
- This code runs everything for you: creation of spheres, compressing it, decompressing it, and displaying the two files on the simulator. I recommend going through the process on the next paragraph step by step.
- Make sure to run the ./5dv command from the executable folder (unless it is in a default path on your machine)
- The new folder path can be absolute (i.e.: /Users/myName/Desktop/MyPrograms/5dv/)


—————————————————————————————————

The best way to understand the process is this:

1) In terminal create a new folder for all the files
mkdir /myFolder3

2) Create the initial uncompressed phrased file (see above)
If that is working you are ready to use the other options like enc/dec

3) Look at the spheres (if you haven’t yet)
./5dv display /myFolder3/spheres.5dvu


4) Compress the spheres to a new 5dv file:
./5dv enc /myFolder3/spheres.5dvu /myFolder3/myCompressedSpheres.5dv


5) The simulator can’t display compressed file, so decompress it. Since this is a lossy compression, the quality in the new uncompressed file will be lower. We are decompressing it for presentation purposes:
./5dv dec /myFolder3/myCompressedSpheres.5dv /myFolder3/myLossySpheres.5dvu

6) Display both original and lossy files. 5dv display can take one or two 5dvu path arguments:
./5dv display /myFolder3/spheres.5dvu /myFolder3/myLossySpheres.5dvu


Discussion:
If you successfully ran these examples, you now know the stages of the process. For more details about the code read the documentation.txt file in the docs folder of the repo
