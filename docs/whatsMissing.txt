5dv - What is missing:

There is a lot of stuff that can be done here. These are just a few. I tried ordering them from the most important to the least:

- Create 3D motion vectors, i frames, p frames and b frames. The current project only compressed each frame on its own

- Compression: Use a smarter compression than zip - dedicated to chroma blocks, using RLE and Hoffman trees (http://www.impulseadventure.com/photo/jpeg-huffman-coding.html)

- A converter from openGL to 5dvu will be a nice addition

- A “processing” version of the simulator will be a nice addition

- Compatibility between 5dv and lookingglassfactory will be a nice addition

- Some initial types for the create mode other than spheres will be nice
